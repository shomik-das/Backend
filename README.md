# Backend Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini backend projects that I created while learning backend development. These projects helped me build a strong foundation in backend technologies by covering a variety of concepts, such as routing, middleware, database integration, authentication, file uploads, and more.

Each project focuses on a specific topic, providing hands-on experience and practical implementation of backend functionalities.

## Projects Overview

### CRUD Operations
- A simple project demonstrating **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** operations.
- Covers basic routing and database interaction to manipulate data effectively.

### Database Search
- Showcase search functionality with database integration.
- Implements optimized querying techniques to retrieve data based on user input.

### HTTP Basics
- A beginner-friendly project covering the essentials of HTTP requests and responses.
- Focuses on understanding how data flows between clients and servers, including request parsing and response handling.

### LoginAll
This section includes several implementations of a user login system, each exploring different technologies and integrations:
- **Login**: A basic login implementation using fundamental backend practices.
- **Login_multer_ejs_db**: Combines user login with file upload, EJS templating for the frontend, and database integration.
- **Login_multer_ejs_mongoose**: Enhances the previous version by introducing Mongoose (MongoDB ORM) for database interaction.
- **Login_multer_mongoose**: Focuses on file upload and user authentication, using Mongoose for streamlined database management.

### MulterAll
A set of projects exploring file upload functionality using the Multer middleware:
- **multer**: Basic file upload handling with Multer.
- **multer_db**: Extends file upload functionality by integrating database storage for metadata or file paths.
- **multer_mongoose**: Combines Multer with Mongoose for efficient and scalable file management in MongoDB.

### TodoAll
A collection of projects implementing a simple todo app for practicing backend logic and CRUD operations:
- **Basic_todo_add_delete_update**: A minimalistic implementation showcasing add, delete, and update functionalities.
- **Create_table_todo_using_fetch**: Enhances the todo app by dynamically updating the frontend using JavaScript `fetch` API to display tasks in a table format.
